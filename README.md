### Suggested Improvements

- **Styled-Components**: The code can be improved by using `styled-components` to customize styles in a more modular and maintainable way. It allows for a more flexible, component-based approach to styling, and reduces the need for hardcoded styles throughout the app.

  To get started with `styled-components`, you can install it with:
  ```bash
  npm install styled-components

 - **Storybook for Component Development**: Implementing Storybook can greatly improve the development process by allowing you to build and test UI components in isolation. It helps to visualize different states of your components and ensures they work as expected.

To get started with Storybook, install it with: 
  
  - npx sb init  

- **Jest for Unit Testing**: Incorporating Jest for unit testing can improve code quality by ensuring that your components and functions are working correctly. Jest provides a simple and effective way to write tests and catch bugs early in the development process.

  - npm install --save-dev jest
